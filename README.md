[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Elavon Payments support for Omnipay. Please see the full [Converge documentation](https://www.myvirtualmerchant.com/VirtualMerchant/download/developerGuide.pdf) for more information.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lemonstand/omnipay-elavon": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* Converge

```php
    $gateway = Omnipay::create('Elavon_Converge');
    $gateway->setMerchantId('[MERCHANT_ID]');
    $gateway->setUsername('[USER_ID]');
    $gateway->setPassword('[USER_PIN]');

    // Test mode hits the demo endpoint.
    $gateway->setTestMode(true);

    try {
        $params = array(
            'amount'                => 10.00,
            'card'                  => $card,
            'ssl_invoice_number'    => 1,
            'ssl_show_form'         => 'false',
            'ssl_result_format'     => 'ASCII',
        );

        $response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();

        if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
            // successful
        } elseif ($response->isRedirect) {
            // Set Callback URL for 3DSecure payments
            $response->setCallbackUrl('https://your.website/callback_url');
            
            // You need to show user redirect form for 3DSecure payment:
            echo $response->getRedirectResponse()->getContent();
        } else {
            throw new ApplicationException($response->getMessage());
        }
    } catch (ApplicationException $e) {
        throw new ApplicationException($e->getMessage());
    }

```

## 3DSecure support

For 3DS payments you also need to make callback page with code:

```php
    $response = $gateway->completePurchase($_POST)->send();
    
    if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
        // successful
    }
```
